I recently completed a comprehensive restaurant data analysis project using SQL, where I explored both menu performance and customer ordering behavior to uncover meaningful business insights.

The project began with an in-depth breakdown of the menu structure, including the total number of items offered, category distribution, and pricing dynamics. By analyzing the data, I identified the most and least expensive dishes, the number of Mexican items available, and price averages across every food category. This helped highlight which menu groups were most diverse, which categories commanded higher price points, and where value opportunities existed.

I then explored the order_details table to understand real customer behavior. This included assessing the full date range of available orders, total order volume, and the number of unique items purchased. I identified which orders contained the most items, how many exceeded 12 items, and the overall ordering patterns across the dataset.

After combining menu and order data, I was able to pinpoint the least and most frequently ordered menu items, along with their categories—revealing clear customer preferences. I also ranked the top 5 highest-spend orders by total value and took a deeper look into those transactions. This provided insight into which categories drove the most revenue, which items were purchased repeatedly within a single order, and how high-value customers engaged with the menu.

Overall, this project strengthened my ability to work with relational databases, perform detailed exploratory analysis, and translate raw SQL outputs into actionable insights for restaurant operations and menu optimization.
